# containerspp

This is a partial implementation of widely used C++ containers (arrays, vectors,
set, map, etc.). This is a learning project and not designed to be a drop-in
replacement for STL/Boost containers.

## Learning Goals

The goals of this project is to improve the programming skills of the authors.
These skills include:

* Using [git and GitHub][poets] for collaborative work.
* Writting data structures with proper C++ memory management practices.
* Generic programming with C++ templates.
* Writing clear and concise documentation (using [Doxygen][dox])
* Adhering to test-driven development.
